This is the main repository for my ontology learning tool(s).

The aim is to provide basic support for ontology learning from Swedish.
In particular, focus is on producing domain ontologies from Swedish text.

This will probably take a lot of inspiration from Text2Onto.

The idea is to make a library that can be used from the command line,
perhaps a GUI, and ideally integrated into a decent ontology editor like
Protege 4.
